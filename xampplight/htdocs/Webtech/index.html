	<h2>Remember to Make Backups!</h2> 
	<p>Make a back up of your work <strong>at least weekly</strong> to be sure you don't lose code that you have worked hard on! To backup your work, copy your entire Webtech folder to another disk. If you ever have a problem with your working disk, you can reinstall your Web server, then copy your backup Webtech folder to the htdocs folder of your new installation. (Windows users: if you re-install the Web server you will want to rename the new Webtech folder that comes with this installation before copying your backup Webtech folder to the htdocs folder).</p>

	<h2>How do I work on my coursework files?</h2>
	<p>Chapter 2 explains this in detail but here are the basic steps to make changes to a file:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Start a text editor</li>
	<li>Open the file you want to work on (or create a new file if that's what you want). These files are located in the appropriate folder under your hdtocs/Webtech/coursework folder, or in the Webtech/samples folder of your installation.</li>
	<li>Edit the file as needed</li>
	<li>Save the file (usually to the same location and with the same file name</li>
	<li>Now you can open the file in your Web browser to view your changes. To do this either return to this page and click the coursework link above to navigate to the link to your file, or simply type the URL directly in your browser window, for example:  http://localhost/Webtech/coursework/Chapter05/Modify1.html</li>
	</ol>
	<p><a href = "#top">Return</a></p>
	<a name="restore"></a>
	<h2>Need to restore an original coursework or samples file?</h2> 
	<p>Sometimes you may make a number of changes to a file in the coursework or samples folders and then wish you could just start again! Your installation includes two folders named <strong>WEBTECH_ORIGINAL_samples</strong> and <strong>WEBTECH_ORIGINAL_coursework</strong>. These folders contain duplicates of the original files that came with your installation. Here two different ways to restore a file from these folders:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Use your text editor to open a file from one of these folders. Then use <strong>Save As</strong> to save the file to the active samples or coursework folder that contains the file you wish to replace. </li>
	<li>Use <strong>My Computer</strong> to navigate to the folder that contains the original file, then copy this file to the active samples of coursework folder that contains the file you wish to replace. You can then edit the file as needed.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>How can get help debugging my code?</h2>
	<p>Appendix D in the textbook contains a lot of useful debugging hints.</p>

	<p><a href = "#top">Return</a></p>
	<h2>How can I edit this page?</h2>
	<p>You can edit this file to suite your own purposes. It is located in your Webtech folder and named index.html. You may find it useful to add some notes of your own, or you may want to include more links, for example if you create additional folders (see below).</p>
	<p>You can also create additional folders if you want to develop your own work. These can be located under the Webtech folder or directly under the htdocs folder. Note that files that are located outside the htdocs folder will not be available for viewing on the Web server unles you change the default document directory settings.</p>
