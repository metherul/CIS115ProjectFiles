	Purpose:  What's wrong here? The program is giving a 100.00 bonus
	 		  although the hours worked is not more than 40!
			  Can you fix it? Hint: the problem is that only the
			  FIRST statement after if ($hoursWorked > 40) is
			  associated with the test, but we want the TWO statements
			  following the test to only be excuted if the test is true.
			  How do we accomplish this? What is missing?
