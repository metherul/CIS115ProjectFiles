	Purpose:Chapter 7 Exercise

	Modify1.html provides a form asking the user to enter their age.
	Modify1.php calculates and displays the number of years until
	retirement, even if the user enters 65 or above!
	Change Modify1.php so that the progam either calculates and displays
	the years until retirement, or else calculates and displays the number of
	years the person has been retired. To do this, use an IF..ELSE structure
	to test the age. Assume that someone less than 65
	is not retired, someone 65 or older is retired
