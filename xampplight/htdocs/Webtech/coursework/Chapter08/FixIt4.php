	Purpose:  This program works but the logic is wrong. The
			  program is supposed to allocate a 100.00 bonus to those
			  who work more than 40 hours, a 50.00 bonus to those who work
			  more than 20 (except those who qualify for a 100.00 bonus),
			  and a 25.00 bonus for everyone else.
			  But there is an error in the code logic which means
			  that anyone who works more than 20 hours gets a 50.00 bonus,
			  even if they worked more than 40 hours. Can you fix the problem?
