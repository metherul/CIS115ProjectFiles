	Purpose:  This program works but the logic is wrong.
			  The program is supposed to first increase the wage
			  of anyone who earns less than 8.00 to 8.00,
			  and then calculate everyone's bonus regardless
			  of their hourly wage. But the bonus is not
			  being given to anyone who earns less than 8.00
			  Can you fix it?
