	Purpose:Chapter 8 Exercise

		Modify1.html does not need to be changed. Change Modify1.php
		so that it will generate an error message if the age is
		less than 0 or greater than 100, otherwise the program should
		calculate and display the years to retirement as listed below.
		Use this error message:
		"<p>ERROR: You entered $age - that is out of range</p>"
-->
