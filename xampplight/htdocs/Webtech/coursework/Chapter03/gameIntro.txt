This game is another from a massive Triple-A developer, starring a massive cast of very known voice actors. The role of this application is to assign a name for character creation.
This file has some weird "code", but hopefully it'll do the trick.

gameIntro.html algorithm:

	Prompt playerName
	Get playerName
	Submit playerName to gameIntro.php

END

gameIntro.php algorithm:

	Recieve playerName from gameIntro.html
	confirmPrompt Text = "Are you sure about this name?" # Ask the user to make sure that they want the name they entered.
	confirmPrompt = visible
	if true: playerNameTag = playerName # Set the floating text above the player to their name.
	else: goto gameIntro.html # Not PHP, I know.
	
END
