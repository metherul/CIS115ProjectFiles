Something is wrong here. Read the requirements then check the algorithms 
carefully and fix the problem:

REQUIREMENT: Write a Web-based application consistng of a Web form
(calcTax.html) and a PHP progam (calcTax.php). The application should:
ask the user for a purchase amount; calculate the tax (7% or 0.07 
of the cost); calculate the total cost; display the purchase amount, tax, and 
total cost.

calcTax.html algorithm:

	Prompt for tax
	Get tax
	Submit tax to calcTax.php
END

calcTax.php algorithm:

	Receive purchaseAmount from calcTax.html
	tax = purchaseAmount * 0.07
	total = purchaseAmount + tax
	Display purchaseAmount, tax, total
END

<!-- FIXED -->

calcTax.html algorithm:

	Prompt for purchaseAmount
	Get purchaseAmount
	Submit purchaseAmount to calcTax.php
END

calcTax.php algorithm:

	Receive purchaseAmount from calcTax.html
	tax = purchaseAmount * 0.07
	total = purchaseAmount + tax
	Display purchaseAmount, tax, total
END

- The variable purchaseAmount is not being recieved in calcTax.php because tax is being passed though instead.
