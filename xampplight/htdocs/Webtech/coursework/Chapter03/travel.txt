This will calculate the "value of your life" based off of the amount of "close calls" you experience while hitchhiking down the middle of a 75mph interstate. 
Note that a "close call" can be anywhere from a hippie chasing you off of their property, or a snake wanting to play chicken.

travel.html algorithm:
	
	Prompt for closeCalls
	Get closeCalls
	Submit closeCalls to travel.php
END

travel.php algorithm:

	Recieve closeCalls from travel.html
	lifeValue = closeCall ** 2
	Display closeCalls, lifeValue
	
END
