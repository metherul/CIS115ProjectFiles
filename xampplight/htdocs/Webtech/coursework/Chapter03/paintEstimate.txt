This program will calculate the price of a can of paint depending on the weight.
Lets just say that the paint is $200 per pound.

paintEstimate.html algorithm:

	Prompt for paintWeight
	Get paintWeight
	Submit paintWeight to paintEstimate.php
END



paintEstimate.php algorithm:

	Recieve paintWeight from paintEstimate.html
	totalCost = paintWeight * 200
	Display paintWeight, totalCost
END
