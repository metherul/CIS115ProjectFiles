    <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Ethan Green.</strong></p>
    <p>I'm a 16 year old high school student from the Madison County Early College. Like you, programming is my thing. I have been programming since 6th grade, with experience in a wide variety in languages. Currently although, C# has been my favorite and most used out of the bunch.</p>
