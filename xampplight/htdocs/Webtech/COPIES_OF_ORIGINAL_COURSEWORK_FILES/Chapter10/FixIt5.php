	Purpose:  What's wrong here?
			  This program is supposed to display the last name and
			  hours worked of all employees in the timesheets.txt file
			  who worked more than 0 hours. There are 8 people
			  in the file who worked more than 0 hours but the
			  program does not display any of them.
			  What's wrong here? HINT: for some reason the loop
			  test is false the very first time so the loop never
			  executes..
