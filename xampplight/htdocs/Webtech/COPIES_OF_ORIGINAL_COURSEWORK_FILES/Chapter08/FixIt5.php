	Purpose:  This program works but the logic is wrong. If the
			  hours worked is a negative number, the program
			  displays an error message but then still processes
			  the wage and displays the results. How you you fix this
			  so that if $hoursWorked is negative, the next
			  if..else structure and the wage output is skipped?
