	Purpose:  This program works but the logic is wrong. It is
			  supposed to give a $100 bonus to anyone when EITHER
			  of the following conditions are true:
			  (1) The employee works  more than 40 hours
			  (2) The employee earns less than 8.00 hourly.
			  Right now it only give the bonus
			  when BOTH of these conditions are true.
			  Can you fix it?
