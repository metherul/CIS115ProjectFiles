Something is wrong here. Read the requirements then check the algorithms 
carefully and fix the problem:

REQUIREMENT: Write a Web-based application consistng of a Web form
(calcTax.html) and a PHP progam (calcTax.php). The application should:
ask the user for a purchase amount; calculate the tax (7% or 0.07 
of the cost); calculate the total cost; display the purchase amount, tax, and 
total cost.

calcTax.html algorithm:

	Prompt for purchaseAmount
	Get purchaseAmount
	Submit purchaseAmount to calcTax.php
END

calcTax.php algorithm:

	Receive purchaseAmount from calcTax.html
	total = purchaseAmount + tax
	tax = purchaseAmount * 0.07
	Display purchaseAmount, tax, total
END
