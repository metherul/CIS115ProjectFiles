	Purpose:Chapter 9 Exercise

				Modify1.html does not need to be changed. Change Modify1.php
				so that it will find the oldest age in ages.txt instead of
				the average age. Hints: You no longer need the  $total or
				$averageAge variables. Refer to Chapter 9 to see how
				to use a loop to find the highest number in a series..
